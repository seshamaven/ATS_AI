# Empty Skills and Unknown Name Fix

## Problem
Resume parsing was returning:
- `"candidate_name": "Unknown"`
- `"primary_skills": ""` (empty)

This occurred even when the resume contained valid names and skills.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Skills Section Verification Too Strict**
The Skills section check was **mandatory** - if a skill wasn't found in the Skills section, it was **completely filtered out**, even if it was a valid TECHNICAL_SKILL.

### 2. **No Fallback for Empty AI Extraction**
If AI returned < 2 skills, no regex fallback was attempted.

### 3. **Name Extraction Heuristic Too Restrictive**
- Only checked first 5 lines
- Only allowed 3-word names (not 4-word like "VARRE DHANA LAKSHMI DURGA")
- Max length was too short

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Made Skills Section Check Advisory** (lines 868-940)
```python
# BEFORE: Skills section check was MANDATORY
if skills_section_text and skill_lower not in skills_section_text:
    logger.warning(f"Skill '{skill}' not found, skipping")
    continue  # ❌ Strictly rejects

# AFTER: Skills section check is ADVISORY
if skills_section_text and not skill_found_in_section:
    logger.info(f"Skill '{skill}' not found in Skills section, but including anyway")
    # Skill is still included because it's in TECHNICAL_SKILLS ✅
```

**Key Change:**
- Skills are now included if they match TECHNICAL_SKILLS
- Skills section check is advisory (logs a message but doesn't reject)
- This handles cases where Skills section is incomplete or uses different formatting

### 2. **Added Regex Fallback for Empty AI Extraction** (lines 869-879)
```python
# If AI extracted no skills or very few, try regex fallback
if not ai_technical_skills or len(ai_technical_skills) < 2:
    logger.warning(f"AI extracted only {len(ai_technical_skills)} skills, trying regex fallback...")
    regex_skills = self.extract_skills(resume_text)
    # Extract all valid TECHNICAL_SKILLS from regex fallback
```

**Key Change:**
- If AI returns < 2 skills, automatically tries regex extraction
- Falls back gracefully to ensure skills are extracted

### 3. **Enhanced Name Extraction Heuristic** (lines 827-845)
```python
# BEFORE:
- Checked first 5 lines
- Allowed only 2-3 words
- Max 50 characters

# AFTER:
- Checks first 10 lines
- Allows 2-4 words (handles "VARRE DHANA LAKSHMI DURGA")
- Max 70 characters
- Explicitly skips emails
- Better alphabetic-only validation
```

**Key Changes:**
```python
for idx, line in enumerate(lines[:10]):  # Was lines[:5]
    if line and 2 <= len(line.split()) <= 4:  # Was <= 3
        if len(line) < 70:  # Was < 50
            # Skip emails explicitly
            if '@' not in line:
                name = line
```

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Logging** (lines 820-827)
```python
logger.warning(f"AI name extraction failed or returned invalid: '{name}', trying regex fallback...")
logger.info(f"Regex fallback returned: {name}")
logger.warning(f"Regex also failed, trying heuristic approach...")
logger.info(f"Found name via heuristic (line {idx+1}): {name}")
```

This helps debug why name extraction fails.

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Skills Not in Skills Section
**Before:** Filtered out completely  
**After:** Included (with warning log)

### Scenario 2: AI Extracts Few Skills
**Before:** Used AI result (might be empty)  
**After:** Triggers regex fallback automatically

### Scenario 3: Name "VARRE DHANA LAKSHMI DURGA"
**Before:** Rejected (4 words, > 3 words limit)  
**After:** Accepted (allows up to 4 words)

### Scenario 4: AI Returns "Unknown" for Name
**Before:** Returned "Unknown"  
**After:** Tries regex → tries heuristic → finds name from first 10 lines

## Expected Results

For the "VARRE DHANA LAKSHMI DURGA" resume with Skills Profile:
```json
{
  "candidate_name": "VARRE DHANA LAKSHMI DURGA",
  "primary_skills": "c#, .net, asp.net, asp.net mvc, .net core, sql server, html5, javascript, css, bootstrap, jquery, azure, visual studio, postman, swagger, rest api, openapi, entity framework, linq"
}
```

## Testing

Re-upload the resume to verify:
1. Name is extracted correctly (not "Unknown")
2. Skills are populated (not empty)
3. Logs show the extraction process
