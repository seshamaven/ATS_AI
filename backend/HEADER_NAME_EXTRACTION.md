# Header Name Extraction Fix

## Problem

The name extraction was too aggressive, potentially skipping valid candidate names that appear in the header section of resumes. The system needed to distinguish between:
1. **Actual candidate names** in the header (should extract these)
2. **Section headers** like "Education", "Experience" (should NOT extract these)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt

Updated the AI extraction prompt to better understand resume structure:

```
IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY:
- Look at the first 2-5 lines of text
- Find the first line that contains 2-3 capitalized words (first + last name)
- This is typically before any section headers or content sections
- The name should be a person's name, NOT a label or description
- Common resume structure: NAME is first, then contact info, then "Education" section
- If you see "Education" or "Experience" first, the name might be above it or you might need to look more carefully
```

### 2. Improved Name Extraction Logic

Updated `extract_name()` to be more lenient with header lines:

```python
# For first 3 lines: be more lenient (might be actual name)
if idx < 3:
    if line and 2 <= len(line.split()) <= 4 and len(line) < 60:
        words = line.split()
        if all(word.isalpha() for word in words):
            # Accept even if ALL CAPS (some resumes have names in all caps)
            return line
```

**Key Changes:**
- First 3 lines are treated specially - more lenient validation
- Accepts ALL CAPS names (many resumes have names in header as all caps)
- Does NOT skip section headers if they appear in first 3 lines
- Accepts longer names (up to 60 chars) in first 3 lines

### 3. Section Header Logic

```python
# Skip section headers (but check if NOT in first 3 lines where actual name might be)
if idx > 2 and line.lower() in invalid_names:
    continue
```

- Section headers like "Education", "Experience" are skipped ONLY after line 3
- In first 3 lines, they're NOT automatically skipped (might be the actual name)
- This handles cases where the name is in the header section

## How It Works Now

### Resume Structure Understanding

The system now understands typical resume layouts:

**Standard Layout:**
```
Line 1: DANIEL MINDLIN (or Daniel Mindlin)
Line 2: Contact information
Line 3: (empty or address)
Line 4: Education section
...
```

**With Name in Header:**
```
Line 1: Header content
Line 2: DANIEL MINDLIN (candidate name)
Line 3: Contact information
Line 4: Education section
...
```

### Processing Flow

1. **First 3 lines** - Lenient processing
   - Accept 2-4 words that look like names
   - Accept ALL CAPS names
   - Accept longer names (up to 60 chars)
   - Do NOT automatically skip section headers

2. **Lines 4-20** - Stricter processing
   - Skip section headers
   - Skip degrees
   - Skip email/phone
   - More validation

3. **Fallback to NLP** - If no name found
   - Uses NLP to find PERSON entities
   - Validates those too

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Handles names in header section** - Now correctly extracts names from headers
2. ✅ **Accepts ALL CAPS names** - Works with resumes where name is styled as all caps
3. ✅ **More flexible** - Doesn't over-filter early lines
4. ✅ **Still rejects invalid content** - Academic degrees, section headers (when appropriate)

## Example Cases

### Case 1: Name in Header (ALL CAPS)
```
Line 1: HEADER INFORMATION
Line 2: JOHN DOE
Line 3: Contact info
...
```
**Result:** Extracts "JOHN DOE" ✓

### Case 2: Name First, Then Education
```
Line 1: Daniel Mindlin
Line 2: Contact info
Line 3: Education
...
```
**Result:** Extracts "Daniel Mindlin" ✓

### Case 3: Education Section Header
```
Line 10: Education
Line 11: University details
...
```
**Result:** Skips "Education" (it's a section header, not a name) ✓

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. Upload a resume with name in the header
2. Upload a resume with name in ALL CAPS
3. Upload a resume where "Education" appears first

All should correctly extract the candidate's name.
