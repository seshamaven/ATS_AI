# Primary Skills Filtering - Implementation

## Overview
Updated the resume parser to restrict `primary_skills` to ONLY include skills from the predefined `TECHNICAL_SKILLS` list. Any skill not in this list will appear in `secondary_skills` instead.

## Problem
Previously, the system would accept any skill extracted from the resume for `primary_skills`, including generic phrases or non-technical skills.

## Solution

### 1. Expanded TECHNICAL_SKILLS List
Added a comprehensive technical skills database covering:
- Programming Languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Frameworks & Libraries (React, Django, Spring, etc.)
- Databases & Data Tools (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Cloud & DevOps (AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Security & Authentication (OAuth, JWT, SSL, etc.)
- AI/ML/Data Science (TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, etc.)
- APIs, Architecture, Monitoring
- CI/CD & Testing (Git, Jenkins, pytest, etc.)
- Frontend/UI/UX
- Mobile/Cross-Platform
- ERP/CRM/Low-Code
- Emerging Tech (Blockchain, IoT, etc.)

### 2. Added Filtering Logic
Implemented filtering in both AI and regex extraction paths:

```python
# AI Extraction Path
for skill in ai_technical_skills:
    skill_lower = skill.lower().strip()
    if skill_lower in self.TECHNICAL_SKILLS:
        technical_skills.append(skill)
    else:
        # Try partial match
        for tech_skill in self.TECHNICAL_SKILLS:
            if skill_lower in tech_skill or tech_skill in skill_lower:
                technical_skills.append(tech_skill)
                break

# Regex Extraction Path
for skill in all_extracted_skills:
    skill_lower = skill.lower().strip()
    if skill_lower in self.TECHNICAL_SKILLS:
        technical_skills_list.append(skill)
    else:
        # Try partial match...
        if not found_match:
            secondary_skills_list.append(skill)
```

### 3. Deduplication
Added deduplication logic to prevent duplicate skills:
```python
technical_skills_set = set()  # For deduplication
```

### 4. Updated AI Prompt
Enhanced the AI prompt to guide extraction toward recognized technical skills:
- Provided examples of valid technical skills
- Specified categories (Programming, Databases, Cloud, etc.)
- Instructed NOT to include phrases or sentence fragments

## How It Works

### Example 1: Valid Technical Skill
- AI extracts: "Python"
- In TECHNICAL_SKILLS? Yes
- Result: Added to `primary_skills` ✅

### Example 2: Partial Match
- AI extracts: "Python programming"
- Exact match? No
- Partial match: "python" exists in TECHNICAL_SKILLS
- Result: "python" added to `primary_skills` ✅

### Example 3: Non-Technical Skill
- AI extracts: "Leadership"
- In TECHNICAL_SKILLS? No
- Partial match? No
- Result: Added to `secondary_skills` ✅

### Example 4: Phrase Rejection
- AI extracts: "in a best possible way in"
- In TECHNICAL_SKILLS? No
- Partial match? No
- Result: Added to `secondary_skills` ✅

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All `primary_skills` follow the same vocabulary
2. **Searchability**: Enables accurate matching against predefined technical skills
3. **Quality**: Filters out invalid skills (phrases, fragments)
4. **Flexibility**: Partial matching ensures variations are normalized (e.g., "Python programming" → "python")

## Database Impact

- `primary_skills`: Will now only contain skills from TECHNICAL_SKILLS list
- `secondary_skills`: Will contain all other skills (soft skills, unrecognized technical terms)
- `all_skills`: Unchanged - contains all extracted skills

## Files Modified

- `resume_parser.py`: 
  - Lines 143-203: Expanded TECHNICAL_SKILLS set
  - Lines 771-798: Added filtering logic for AI extraction
  - Lines 846-877: Added filtering logic for regex extraction
  - Line 88: Updated AI prompt for technical skills extraction

## Testing

When a resume is processed:
1. All extracted skills are checked against TECHNICAL_SKILLS
2. Only matching skills appear in `primary_skills`
3. Non-matching skills appear in `secondary_skills`
4. Deduplication prevents duplicate entries
5. Partial matching handles variations and common phrases

## Next Steps

To add more technical skills, update the `TECHNICAL_SKILLS` set in `resume_parser.py` (lines 143-203).
